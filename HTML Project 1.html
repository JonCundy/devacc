        <h3><b>What is a Commit?</b></h3>
        <p><i>A Git commit is a snapshot of the hierarchy (Git tree) and the contents of the files (Git blob) in a Git repository. These endpoints allow you to read and write commit objects to your Git database on GitHub.</i></p>
        <h3><b>What is a branch?</b></h3>
        <p><i>A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch â€” the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.</i></p>
        <h3><b>What is a Pull Request?</b></h3>
        <p><i>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.</i></p>
        <h3> <b> Other Useful Information</b></h3>
        <p><i>Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was made.</i></p>
